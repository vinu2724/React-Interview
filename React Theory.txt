1.	What is React, and how does it work internally?

What is React?
React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs), especially for single-page applications (SPAs). It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the UI with its virtual DOM mechanism.

How React Works Internally?
Component-Based Architecture

Everything in React is built using components (functional or class-based).

Components can be nested, reused, and managed independently.

Virtual DOM (VDOM)

React creates a Virtual DOM, a lightweight copy of the real DOM.

Instead of updating the actual DOM directly (which is slow), React updates the VDOM first.

Then, it compares the new VDOM with the previous one using a diffing algorithm.

React applies only the necessary changes to the real DOM, making updates efficient.

Reconciliation (Diffing Algorithm)

React identifies what has changed in the VDOM.

It updates only the modified parts in the real DOM (batch updates) instead of re-rendering the entire page.

React Fiber Architecture (introduced in React 16)

Optimized rendering engine for better UI performance.

It breaks rendering work into smaller tasks, making UI updates smoother (avoids blocking the main thread).

Improves concurrent rendering for animations, transitions, and large lists.

State and Props Management

State: Stores component-specific data that affects rendering.

Props: Data passed from parent to child components to maintain consistency.

React updates the UI whenever state changes.

Event Handling

Uses a synthetic event system for better performance and cross-browser compatibility.

React does not attach events directly to elements but delegates them efficiently.

React Hooks (For Functional Components)

Introduced in React 16.8, allows managing state and side effects without class components.

Common hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef, useReducer, etc.

React Rendering Process

Initial render creates the VDOM.

When state or props change, React updates the VDOM.

React compares the new VDOM with the previous one and updates only the necessary parts in the real DOM.

Why is React Fast?
✔ Uses Virtual DOM instead of updating the real DOM directly.
✔ Batch updates minimize unnecessary re-renders.
✔ Fiber Architecture improves rendering performance.
✔ One-way data flow makes state management predictable.
